# BitCamp 2018 - Twitter Emotion/Sentiment Analysis Continued

After Bit-Camp

I have fixed the problem where any tweet with an emoji was skipped, now I remove the emoji and perform all calculations on the emoji-less tweet. Also, the user of the program now has the option to enter the amount of tweets they want to see, with a default of 50 tweets. If the user enter a negative number of tweets the program runs with the default 50 tweets, and if the user enters a number more than the number of tweets the user will see all the tweets of that account.

Problems that still exist:
- When a tweet is retweeted it still starts with RT

This project was made during the 2018 BitCamp event at the University of Maryland College Park. We did this as an expierence to expose ourselves to new applications that we had not yet used.

This project will analyze data about the relationships between twitter users. The program will take in a twitter handle, and parse all the tweets of that twitter handle in the past 30 days. From this we will analyze the connections between the current handle and all other connections referred to in the users tweets, like other twitter handles and hashtags. We use the free version of Indico, a sentiment analysis program to obtain the rating of the tweets.

While creating the program we learned a bit about Indico. Because of this we found aspects of its analysis we thought were inconsistent, such as:
	- Indico was not affected by everything being capitilized
	- @ symbols at, what appears to be, a random effect on the sentiment rating of all messages. For example, sometimes adding more @ symbols would raise the sentiment rating and other times it would lower the rating.
	- Just like @ symbols the # symbol would have a random effect on the sentiment rating of all messages.

Because of what we found we chose to remove all @ and # from the text before we used Indico to find the sentiment rating.

We also encountered tweets having links to articles and pictures. To deal with this we removed all substrings of "https:://". This will make using the Indico API more successful.

Issues in the program:
- When a Tweet starts with "RT" which means retweet we have no reliable way to deal with this. This is because some tweets start with the text "RT" meaning real time
- A similar issue persists with being able to read and understand the sentiment and emotional value of emojiis
- Emojis cause a LOT of problems
- For some reason Tweepy does not get all tweets, mainly the one's with Hashtags
- Does not always get all the available tweets

The concept of this project fails at understanding things in context. For example, when someone links something they agree with and talk about how sad it is that it happened. The program believes that it is having negative, and affects it even though in some perspectives this does not make since.
